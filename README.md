This is a project from Odin Project to demonstrate fundamental HTML and CSS skills. The webpage to build was provided as a png and then built from scratch to match the picture.

The HTML skills that have been taught and to be used in this project are constructing a boilerplate, using links and images, linking an external CSS file.

In terms of HTML skills that haven't been taught we are asked to use divs for almost everything, however, using semantic HTML in my opinion would be a good skill and habit to develop from the beginning.

With regards to CSS, the box model has been taught, however, the flexbox model is the predominate way of styling and structuring a website so that is what has been used. Other skills are fundamental CSS styles in terms of text styling and background.

There are elements of the website that haven't been taught that are asked to be researched such as rounded corners for containers.

This project has been pushed to Github as this is also a good skill and habit to develop from the beginning.

I've also written this before starting the project, to be honest, I think this is the wrong way of doing this as I write this.
